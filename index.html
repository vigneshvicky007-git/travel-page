            <h1>What We Do</h1>
            <p>Opportunities for challenging hikes and pleasant strolls are scattered all over this planet; you just need to know where to find them. We do. Kilimanjaro, Everest Base Camp, Patagonia, and the Inca Trail are out there, waiting for you to walk
                all over them. We’re proud of our record of successful ascents (over 92% of our travellers make it to the top of Kili, depending on the route), but it’s our CEOs and local guides that make the journey itself as memorable as the summit.
                And if you’re not into big climbs, don’t sweat it; we’ve got loads of lower-impact walks and iconic treks you’ll love, too.</p>

  Leigh McAdam has been making my travel arrangements
  for about 20 years and there is no one else I would
 trust to arrange my trips and tours.I've also had
 great fun on a few of the group trips she has arranged
 Peru & Machu Picchu and a 10-day cruise out of Venice
  and diving. It's always an eclectic group of well 
    traveled,interesting people.
